# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
By making API requests with API keys from the frontend, this leaves the API key exposed to unauthorized users. This is dangerous as they can have access to sensitive information, mess with the information, or create more keys (can be costly). 

To combat this, we can make an API request from the server while using environment variables. This means important information like an API key are stored in a `.env `file. The file can live in a host machine (your computer) or a website that helps with rendering (like Render).
